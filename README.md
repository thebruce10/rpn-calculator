# rpn-calculator

This is a calculator that uses reverse polish notation (rpn). Also known as postfix notation, rpn places the operator ofter both of the operands as opposed to the commonly used infix notation, removing the need for brackets.

e.g. `1 + 1` in infix notation becomes `1 1 +` in rpn and `(3 + 5) * 6` in infix notation becomes `3 5 + 6 *` in rpn.
